However, classes add another level of complexity with instance variables. Remember the difference between local and global variables is their scope. Local varibles have local or function scope, that is that they are only able to be accessed inside the function in which they are defined. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the file. Below is an example to jog your memory, if this is a little confusing:  "
